                    When the wider community was told to stay at home, a few earth angels took 
                    their place in the community to help and protect us. We wanted to show 
                    them that we appreciated all that they were doing for us. When the supermarket 
                    shelves were empty we delivered food parcels to keyworkers to help in a small way. 
                    Thanks to the kindess and generosity of Oregano Institute of Hotel Management 
                    we have been able to provide over 5000 meals to key workers, families 
                    and individuals across London.

                    Food poverty is prominent in our community and we strongly believe 
                    that as a community we will be able to help make a difference to offer 
                    support to those who need it. We offer a collection and drop off service 
                    for the community to make grocery donations. We have been able to help 
                    support local schools, children centres,  and local groups and charities. 
                    Our Community Cupboard initiative has enabled us to reach smaller communties 
                    by providing them regular access to food and toiletries to help ensure that 
                    their families do not go hungry. We accept referrals from the general public, 
                    local group, schools and charities to ensure the help gets to where it is needed.

                    We live in a wasteful society and we want to help encourage sustainable living.  
                    We work closely with local groups to rescue suprlus food, we also have a pre-loved 
                    donation collection program that is trying to redistribute and redirect items away 
                    from the landfill. We have saved over 100,000 tonnes of food waste and over 500,000 
                    tonnes of clothes, books, toy and furniture donations that would have otherwise gone
                    to the landfill. With our wide network of contacts we are able to ensure that everything
                    is put back into circulation, and if it can't be used we have been up-cycling and getting
                    creative to keep them away from the landfill.

                    hospices, schools, supermarkets, charities and individuals with all areas of PPE, 
                    including gloves, N95 masks, gowns, face masks, hand sanitiser and more to help our

                    We have sewn over 5000 masks that have been donated across London, alongside a 
                    national iniative we have been providing high quality face masks to distribute 
                    to hospitals, schools, homeless shelters, womens refuge's, refugee's and the 
                    community. We have also raised over £2000 for The Royal British Legion and £1200 
                    for Get on Downs, Down Syndrome support group. Thanks to a wonderful team of 
                    volunteers we have been able to collect donations of materials to be transformed
                    and redisturbited. As a zero waste group, all scraps have been saved for other projects.
